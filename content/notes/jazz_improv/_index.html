<h1 id="week-1-introduction">Week 1: Introduction</h1>
<p>Chords and Scales in improvisation is the equivalent of words in spoken language. It’s what builds up the vocabulary of improvisation. The progression of harmonies is what creates a sort of grammar in improvisation. Melodic themes and development is the content of improvisation.</p>
<h1 id="week-2-the-10-most-important-scales">Week 2: The 10 Most Important Scales</h1>
<p>12 keys x 10 scales = 120 scales to memorize.<br />
The modes from Brightest to Darkest</p>
<ul>
<li><p><strong>Lydian</strong> - Raised 4th, Major</p></li>
<li><p><strong>Ionian</strong> - No Change, Major</p></li>
<li><p><strong>Mixolydian</strong> - Lowered 7th, Dominant 7</p></li>
<li><p><strong>Dorian</strong> - Lowered 3rd and 7th, Minor</p></li>
<li><p><strong>Aeolian</strong> - Lowered 3rd, 6th, and 7th, Minor</p></li>
<li><p><strong>Phrygian</strong> - Lowered 2nd, 3rd, 6th, and 7th, Minor</p></li>
<li><p><strong>Locrian</strong> - Lowered 2nd, 3rd, 5th, 6th, and 7th, Minor</p></li>
</ul>
<p>Notice as how we lower more notes, the modes become “darker”<br />
The last 3 scales are</p>
<ul>
<li><p><strong>Lydian b7</strong> - Raised 4th Lowered 7, Dominant 7</p></li>
<li><p><strong>Altered Scales</strong> - Root, b9, #9, 3, #11, b13, b7, Dominant 7</p></li>
<li><p><strong>Symmetrical Diminished</strong> - Root, b9, #9, 3, #11, 5, 6, b7, Dominant 7</p></li>
</ul>
<p>We can throw the 5th into the altered scale We want to learn/recognize these scales based on <strong>the pattern they make</strong> and <strong>the sound they make.</strong></p>
<h1 id="week-3-choosing-chord-scales">Week 3: Choosing Chord Scales</h1>
<p><strong>For Major Scales:</strong><br />
To figure out which chord scale we use, first we try to look at the given melody to figure out what chord to use. For example if we have a C7 chord, we can say lets use the C Lydian scale. If it doesn’t appear or there is just no melody, then look at the previous chord. For example if the previous chord was a G7 and the current chord is a C7, we can assume that we should use the C Ionian scale since F natural appears in the previous chord.<br />
<strong>For Minor Chord Scales:</strong><br />
To figure out which chord scale for minor scales, first you ask what’s going on with the 6th and then what’s going on with the 2nd. This should give you enough information to differentiate between Dorian, Aeolian, and Phrygian. For Locrian scales, you’ll usually know it when you see it since the composer would explicitly mark a b5.<br />
<strong>For Dominant 7 Chord Scales:</strong><br />
To figure out which chord scale for dom7 chord scales, first you ask what’s going on with the 4th. This should differentiate between Mixolydian and Lydian b7. For altered scales and symmetrical diminished you just gotta look real hard(?). Altered scales occur a lot more than symmetrical diminished so your first guess should be altered.</p>
<h1 id="week-4-harmony">Week 4: Harmony</h1>
<p><strong>Guide Tones</strong> are the notes that signify the chord change. For example when moving from a Bb7 to Eb7 the “guide tones” would be the Ab moving to a G and the D moving to an Eb. A <strong>guide line</strong> is a bunch of chord tones that move up/down similar to a scale and were each note in that scale is a chord tone of its respective chord. These are useful when we’ve got very fast changes (e.g. every 2 beats). If we find a guide line in the base notes then we can also find another guide line in the 3rds. We can use guide lines to organize improvisation over quick chord changes. Sometimes we’ll find a sequence of chords sharing a <strong>common scale</strong> which will allow us to group those chords and create longer melodies. <strong>Constant structure</strong> is where a sequence of chords have the same type. E.g. Cmaj7 - Dbmaj7 - Ebmaj7. Chromatics are also useful too. Throw them in every once in a while.</p>
<h1 id="week-5-themes-and-variation">Week 5: Themes and Variation</h1>
<p>Listeners want to experience some sort of pleasant feeling, sounds, and storyline when listening to music.<br />
<strong>Three Characteristics to Melodic Theme</strong></p>
<ol>
<li><p>Rhythm</p></li>
<li><p>Melodic shape</p></li>
<li><p>Suggested Harmony</p></li>
</ol>
<p>Ideas for variations of the theme.</p>
<ul>
<li><p>Reverse it</p></li>
<li><p>Move to a different inversion</p></li>
<li><p>Play with the tempo</p></li>
<li><p>Extend it</p></li>
<li><p>Add embellishments</p></li>
</ul>
<p>The challenge is adapting the theme to fit the changing chords and harmonies.<br />
When we’re playing, we have to play in sentences. That is, sometimes we need to pause and let the audience absorb what they’re hearing. We should also vary the lengths of our sentences.<br />
