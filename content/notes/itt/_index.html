<h1 id="chapter-two-notes">Chapter Two: Notes</h1>
<p>We’ll start by thinking of music a made of notes. Notes can be characterized by four properties.</p>
<ol>
<li><p>Pitch - the frequency of the sound</p></li>
<li><p>Point in time when it begins and ends</p></li>
<li><p>Loudness - the energy the sound wave carries</p></li>
<li><p>Tone color/timbre - distribution of energy at various frequencies as well as how the energy accumulates/dissipates.</p></li>
</ol>
<p>We’re focus on measuring/quantifying pitch and time of a note much more than we do for the loudness and timbre. To measure pitch/time we usually put them in a <em>reference system</em> (I guess the same thing as a reference frame in physics).</p>
<h2 id="pitch">Pitch</h2>
<p>A pitch is how high or low a note is. We identify pitches by relating them to a specific collection and compare pitches by relating both pitches to a specific collection. I guess an example of this would be how the 440Hz is <span class="math inline">\(A_4\)</span> on the piano.<br />
Lets examine one collection that everyone knows about, the <strong>Chromatic Collection</strong> which is measured by <strong>semitones.</strong> Lets first play one note on the piano, and if we go exactly one key higher (e.g. from a C to a C#) then the difference between the pitches of those two notes (should) be the exact same difference between the pitches of the note one key higher and two keys higher (e.g. from C# to D). The difference in these pitches are called semitones. A collection of pitches that are separated by semitones is called a chromatic collection. Using this notion of semitones we can also start comparing pitches by describing their difference in semitones. For example, C and D differ by 2 semitones.<br />
<br />
Lets move onto another collection hm? An interval of twelve semitones is very special. For example, if we play the highest note on the piano and then a note 12 semitones lower, what do we get? The same note but an octave down. Despite the fact that they’re obviously not the same pitch, we can accept they’re the same note. A collection or set of notes that are separated by 12 semitones is called a <strong>Pitch Class.</strong><br />
<br />
Now just one more collection. Consider the intervals between notes if we only use the white keys starting at a C. We’ll notice that there’s a repeating pattern every 7 notes. We’ll denote semitone as ST and two semitones as a whole tone of WT. The pattern goes<br />
<span class="math display">\[WT\text{ }WT \text{ }ST \text{ }WT \text{ }WT \text{ }ST\]</span><br />
We can do this pattern starting on other notes too(this is obviously a scale but pretend you don’t know that.) A set of pitches separated by this pattern is called a <strong>Diatonic Collection.</strong> Since there are twelve pitches to start on in the chromatic collection, there are twelve diatonic collections if we work from the frame of reference of the chromatic collection.</p>
<h3 id="notating-pitch">Notating Pitch</h3>
<p>To notate pitch we use a five line staff were we can put a note on a line of between two lines. Notes of the same pitch fall on the same line/space and notes adjacent in the diatonic collection are on the adjacent lines and spaces. We use a clef to denote which line/space corresponds to which pitch and we use a key signature to denote what diatonic collection we are using. We can use <em>accidentals</em> to denote notes that are not in a diatonic collection. By putting a sharp(<span class="math inline">\(\sharp\)</span>) we can demonstrate that we want to play a note a semitone higher and putting a flat(<span class="math inline">\(\flat\)</span>) we can demonstrate that we want to play a note a semitone lower. There are also double-sharps, double-flats, and naturals.</p>
